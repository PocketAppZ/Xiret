# Xiret
This program was written as the Windows Experience Index UI was removed in Windows 8.1. Many applications that imitate the experience index either a. do not work properly, or b. have many adverts, so I created something stable and free. Version 1 of this project was never published as open-source.

_Key features:-_
 - Clean and friendly UI
 - Easily export scores as an image or text
 - See rated system hardware with a simple toggle
 - Imgur API for simple uploading (API Client ID included)
 - High DPI support
 - Normal and verbose assessment modes
 - Made with portability in mind
 - Windows Vista - 10 support

## Current version
2.1.0 Build 1JA12 (Release, *Stable*). Application written and compiled in Visual Studio 2019 with **.NET Framework 4.0**. Version 2.2.x is on the way, with a projected release of mid April 2021.

## Motivation
Initially, Xiret was created to pass some time when the Experience Index UI was removed in Windows 8.1. Since it's growing into V2 I though 'why not share?'. VB isn't too hard to get into and it may help someone learn a thing or two, like I did. Other motivation was anti-virus engines flagging this software as malware, now everyone can see its guts they know they're safe.

## Donations
Please use the donation window in Xiret (Help > Donate). Donations don't go into my own pocket, rather let me invest in new technologies. I've a whole range of products in development and a website planned out.
