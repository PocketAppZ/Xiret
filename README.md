# Xiret
Xiret is a simple but powerful tool designed to replace the Experience Index User Interface that was removed in Windows 8.1. It features a beautiful, easy to use custom UI, no adverts or spam, and is completely free forever. It's compatible with all versions of Windows that shipped with the Experience Index (excluding server versions). This program was written as the Windows Experience Index UI was removed in Windows 8.1. Many applications that imitate the experience index either a. do not work properly, or b. have many adverts, so I created something stable and free.

_Key features:-_

 · Clean, friendly and easy to use UI built for novice and expert users alike
 · View and generate Windows Experience Index scores with minimal effort*
 · Built using the WInSAT API for high compatibility
 · Options to save scores as text or an image
 · Imgur API for super simple and immediate upload for sharing
 · Automatic power adapter detection
 · High DPI support
 · In-Depth assessment mode
 · Portable with easily managed settings
 · Self monitoring for missing resources like fonts and patches
 · Option to reset Winsat with one click
 · Notification and downloader for when a new version is available**
 · Ability to see the Windows 10 feature level
 · The 'Show Hardware' toggle instantly shows you which hardware was rated

## Current version
2.1.0 Build 1JA12 (Release, *Stable*). Application written and compiled in Visual Studio 2019 with **.NET Framework 4.0**. Version 2.2.x is on the way, with a projected release of mid April 2021.

## Motivation
Initially, Xiret was created to pass some time when the Experience Index UI was removed in Windows 8.1. Since it's growing into V2 I though 'why not share?'. VB isn't too hard to get into and it may help someone learn a thing or two, like I did. Other motivation was anti-virus engines flagging this software as malware.
